<tr><td align="center"><div class="body">WCC provides two major benefits over our competitors. First, we order the same parts as major companies such as Dell, HP, and Alienware but can put them together with almost zero overhead. This means you get the same, if not higher quality computer but at a lower price. Second, we are about as personal of a computer buying experience as you can get. What other company allows you to request a computer for us to build? In short, you get exactly what you want at the price you want.
