<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>
Miami University's <a href="http://miamioh.edu/cec/about/centers-institutes/lockheed-martin/index.html" target="_blank">Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute</a> puts a big focus on being active and professional on social media to help spread the ideas and accomplishments of the institute and support a professional image online. This project is designed to easily view twitter activity in real time for a select group of users.
</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>
Below is a live demo of the project. It includes two main parts: a front facing html page and a separate php backend. The php backend is not included in the <a href="https://github.com/mdepero/twitter" target="_blank">github repo</a> of the source code because it contains twitter api keys that I don't want to make public.
