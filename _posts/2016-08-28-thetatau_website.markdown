I joined the Tau Delta chapter of Theta Tau at Miami University the spring semester of 2016. The organization has been incredible, and I immediately ran for the technology chair position with the plans to lead a total redesign of their website. The site, <a href="http://thetataumiami.com" target="_BLANK">thetataumiami.com</a>, has a wide array of upcoming features, including the ability to track information on members, organize and track attendance at events, archive photos, help with recruitment, and more.
