In CSE385 at Miami University, our team of five's semester project was to create a database application that was applicable to the real world. For our project, we decided to go with a task management and project management system that allowed project managers to delegate "sub projects" to different teams and then let those teams create task lists for their teams to complete. The project acted as a great experience in working with a small team on a large project and utilizes JQuery and PHP to interact with the database.
