CSE451 at Miami University is a class about web services and service oriented architecture. For our final project, we were required to utilize 3 REST API services, Amazon Web Services, KML (Keyhole Markup Language), and OAUTH. My project Uses API to generate a route from your current location to a location of your choice, converts that route into a KML path, and allows you to share that KML path on Twitter utilizing AWS S3 as a content delivery platform.
